– Provides an execution environment for running programs
– Provides an abstract view of the underlying computer system
Processors Processes, threads
Memory Virtual memory address spaces
Storage Files, directories
I/O devices Files (ioctls)
Networks Files (sockets, pipes, …)

resource use
… and make all of them happy
– Resource manager
OS allocates and manages various resources of a computer system
» CPU, Memory, I/O devices, …
Decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
– A control program

Operating System Services (1/3)
• OS services provide functions that are helpful to the user:
1) User interface
Varies between Command-Line Interface (CLI), Graphics User Interface (GUI), etc.
2) Program execution
Load a program into memory and run the program
End execution, either normally or abnormally (indicating error)
3) I/O operations
A running program may require I/O, which may involve a file or an I/O device
4) File-system manipulation
Programs need to create, delete, read, and write files and directories
Search, list file information, permission management, …

5) Communications
Processes may exchange information, on the same computer or between 
computers over a network
» Via shared memory or through message passing (packets moved by the OS)
6) Error detection
Constantly aware of possible errors
» May occur in the CPU and memory hardware, in I/O devices, in user program
» Take an appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing
» Debugging facilities can greatly enhance the user’s and programmer’s abilities to efficiently 
use the system

Operating System Services (3/3)
• Another set of OS functions exists for ensuring the efficient operation of 
the system itself via resource sharing
1) Resource allocation
When multiple users or multiple jobs run concurrently, resources must be 
allocated to each of them
Many types of resources - CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, I/O devices
2) Accounting
Keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of computer resources
3) Protection and security
Protection involves ensuring that all access to system resources is controlled
Security of the system from outsiders requires user authentication, and extends to 
defending external I/O devices from invalid access attempts

Computer System Organization
• A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more 
CPUs and device controllers connected through a common bus 
providing access to the main memory
• Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices compete for memory cycles

Computer System Operation
• Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type
• Each device controller has a local buffer
• I/O is data transfer from the I/O device to the controller or vice versa
• CPU moves data from the controller to the main memory or vice versa

Programmed I/O (a.k.a. polling)
• CPU repeatedly checks the state of an I/O device through a device 
controller
– e.g., whether the requested I/O operation is completed…
• If its state is ready, CPU directly moves data required for an I/O 
operation
• CPU must always be involved in I/O operation handling 
CPU resource can be used inefficiently
– CPU may waste substantial time waiting for I/O devices to be ready (busy 
waiting)

Interrupt Handling Process
18
1. OS preserves the current state of the CPU
– To come back after handling the interrupt
– Save registers and the address of the 
interrupted instruction to the memory
2. Jumps to a designated interrupt service 
routine (called interrupt handler)
– Interrupt vector contains the addresses of 
all the service routines
3. Return to the last state by restoring the 
registers
Flow of interrupt handling

Interrupt timeline
• An operating system is interrupt-driven
– Hardware interrupt generated by hardware devices (I/O devices)
Asynchronous event independent on a currently-executing process
– Software interrupt generated by executing instructions
Synchronous event always generated by a currently-executing process
Software error (e.g., division by zero), request for operating system service, etc.

– Because CPU doesn’t have to do busy waiting
• However, CPU burden increases when moving a large amount of data

Direct Memory Access (DMA) I/O
• Uses a specific hardware for handling I/O operation
– called DMA controller
• CPU requests an I/O operation to DMA controller
• DMA controller performs data transfer between DC and main memory 
without CPU intervention
• DMA controller notifies CPU of I/O operation completion by generating 
an interrupt
• Benefits
– CPU can perform other tasks while an I/O operation is being processed
– Used for high-speed I/O devices to transmit information at close to memory 
speeds

Multiprogramming
• One of the most important aspects of OS is the ability to run multiple 
programs
24
• Multiprogramming needed for efficiency
– A single program cannot keep either CPU or I/O 
devices busy at all times
– Multiprogramming organizes jobs (code and data) so 
that CPU always has one to execute (= never idle)
– A subset of total jobs in system is kept in memory
– One job selected and run via job scheduling
– When it has to wait for I/O, OS switches to another job

Multitasking
• Multitasking(= Time-sharing) is a logical extension of multiprogramming
in which CPU switches jobs frequently so that users can interact with 
each running job, creating interactive computing
– If several jobs are ready to run at the same time CPU scheduling
Each job is given a time slice
Run a job for a time slice and then switches to the next job
– Response time should be < 1 second

Protecting the System
• Dual-mode operation: CPU operates in “user mode” or “kernel mode” 
– Allows OS to protect itself and other system components
Separate critical things from general things
– Mode bit (provided by hardware) allows to distinguish on which mode the 
system is running (0: kernel mode, 1: user mode)
– All privileged instructions are only executable in the kernel mode
E.g., HLT in x86
• Modern CPUs support more than two 
modes (i.e., multi-mode operations)
– i.e. virtual machine manager (VMM) 
mode for guest VMs
– VMs should be limited to its space for 
memory access

• A set of instructions that should be executed carefully

Control registers
Interrupt service routine table
– Memory state management
Page table updates, page table pointers, TLB loads, etc
– HLT instruction in IA-32
• Executable in the kernel mode
– May generate an exception (fault) if an application tries to run a privileged          
instruction in user mode

Interrupt vs. Exception
• Exception (= Software interrupt)
– Generated by executing instructions
Software error (e.g., division by zero), unauthorized access to data, request for 
operating system service, …
– Synchronous
Happens when CPU executes an instruction
– Trap(expected, intended) or fault(unexpected)
– Handled like interrupts
• C.f., interrupt (= Hardware interrupt)
– Generated by hardware devices
– Occurs asynchronously (at any time)
• Modern OSes are interrupt(including exception)-driven
– The transition from user mode to kernel mode is done via interrupt or 
exception

• By interrupt

In the user mode, an application process keeps using the CPU
The timer generates a timer interrupt when the timer expires
» Switched to the kernel mode
The OS can make a decision on which process will be executed next

System Call Implementation
• Typically, each system call is associated 
with an unique number (system call 
number)
– System-call interface maintains a table 
indexed according to these numbers
• The system call interface invokes the 
intended system call in OS kernel and 
returns status of the system call and any 
return values
45
• The caller needs to know nothing about how the system call is 
implemented
– Just needs to obey API and understand what OS will do for system call
– Most details of OS interface are hidden from programmer by API
